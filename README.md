# Hand-Gesture-Classifier
## Jupyter Notebook Source Code | Gesture Classifier.ipynb

Hand gesture classifier using openCV and Python

This program runs a real-time window on your machine, and will identify the following gestures in realtime:

0 shape with hand.
1, 2, 3, 4 Fingers up on hand.
Thumb up/down.


This model is comprised of a sequential convolutional neural network that trains on my given dataset, of my hand doing the various gestures, then saves it's optimal model weghts and params to a .h5 file and a .json file respectively, so that training is not needed for the program to run.

You may test the accuracy for yourself, but on my own hand, and on other internal tests from the university staff, the model is very accurate.
